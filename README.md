# Data Science Portfolio
My portfolio of academic and professional projects. Create description of what portfolio is.

## Projects:

### [Hotel NPS Analysis](https://github.com/cluceroSy4/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Hotel%20NPS%20Analysis/IST687%20Project%20Code.R)
* Extensive analysis of hotel data using R to build a business case for using Net Promoter Score
* Used linear regression to determine the impact of NPS on hotel revenue
* Used SVM model to predict above or below average NPS scores from guest survey responses
* Used Association Rule Mining to determine important combinations of hotel characteristics that may influence NPS
